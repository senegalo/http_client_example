This is a small Java application with an example on how to make a http request from a Java application

The code is commented in the [Client Class](https://github.com/senegalo/http_client_example/blob/master/src/main/java/Client.java)

I am using Gradle in this app to manage the dependencies. I have only one dependency which is the Apache HttpClient you can find it in the [build.gradle](https://github.com/senegalo/http_client_example/blob/master/build.gradle#L14)

The full documentaion for the library can be found in the [official apache](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/tutorial/html/fundamentals.html)
